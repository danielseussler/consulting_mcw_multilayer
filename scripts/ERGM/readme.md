# Estimation Strategy: Multilayer ERGMs

## Descriptions

check.R helper script which checks for NA's in later used data 
setup, not required to run


estimation hyper.R script to determine hyper parameters in the 
decay values of gwesp. grid search of dependence model in the year 2008 (network rise in densities, hence median of time period) estimated by mple (because feasible)


estimation model 2003.R


evaluation.R



## To Do's for the ERGM model

- fix NA's in polity and ia nmc i.e. transparent implementation
- check if correct specficiation of nodal io covariates is implemented
- list of coefficients for binomial model as cornelius proposed
- glm mgcv binomial yearly interaction model 
- iptd data adapt by sector - test energy network density


- plot overview over categories of trend
- easy statistics for development of trade i..e mining vs. services etc.
