# SAOM Model
Stochastic actor-oriented model

Key points on SAOMs:

* models network changes over time
* changes from the perspective of the nodes (actors)
* actors are influenced by the networks structure and characteristics of the respective pair of nodes
* tries to explain how these factors influence with the network evolution over time
* ego and alter notation
* action of the egos does not correspond to action in a real-world sense
* a time step decomposed into multiple mini-steps which correspond to actor decisions
* cannot interpreted causally immediately
* can model co-evolution of networks
* binary networks
* takes monadic and dyadic covariates into account
* effects models log-probability for creation, maintenance, or presence of network ties
* 3 possible functions for SAOM models in RSiena
